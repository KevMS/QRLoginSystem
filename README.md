# QRLoginSystem

This project was created for a school assignment and focuses on enhancing login security by integrating QR code functionality.

**Features**

1. Registration with QR Code Generation:
   
- After registration, the system automatically generates a unique QR code for each user. This QR code can be used for logging into the system.

2. Multiple Login Methods:

- Email and Password with OTP: Users can log in using their email and password, followed by a one-time password (OTP) for added security.
- QR Code Login: Users can log in by scanning their unique QR code.

3. Improved Security:

- The system offers an additional layer of security through QR code-based login.

**Improvements**

This system is a work in progress and may benefit from the following enhancements:

- User Interface: Simplifying and improving the design for a better user experience.
- Security Measures: Adding more robust security features, such as two-factor authentication.
- Code Optimization: Refactoring the code for better performance and maintainability.
- Error Handling: Implementing comprehensive error handling to enhance reliability.
